Excel Project: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

I recently completed an advanced Excel project focused on analyzing sales data for a coffee shop. The project involved:

Data Visualization: Created a comprehensive dashboard showcasing key metrics such as total sales, total footfall, average bill per person, and average orders per person.
Category Analysis: Analyzed and visualized the percentage distribution of sales across various product categories, including bakery, coffee, tea, and more.
Trend Analysis: Illustrated sales trends based on hours and days, providing insights into peak hours and days for coffee shop visits.
Location Performance: Compared footfall and sales across different store locations, highlighting top-performing stores.
Product Performance: Identified and visualized the top 5 products based on sales, offering insights into customer preferences.
Order Size Distribution: Visualized the distribution of order sizes, enabling better inventory management and marketing strategies.
This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling using Excel, demonstrating my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.
